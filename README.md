# Better-Team-Bot
Intermediate Software Design class project
The better team bot project is about creating an automated way for users on 
Research projects to seek help from their team lead and to be provided extra 
Tools in the form of viewing a transcript in order to get a better understanding of
Their daily and weekly tasks. It is meant to streamline the process of asking for help 
In a project.
